# Network Spotify Artists

In this repository, a study is carried out with a co-occurrence network using the names of the artists of the songs from playlists found in a dataset. For this, the Python programming language and some packages were used to handle the data and generate graphics.

The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset was used to build the network, which contains 1,000,000 playlists created by users on the Spotify platform. The co-occurrence network is built with nodes representing the artists and an edge is added between two artists when they are on the same playlist.

## Dataset
  
The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset can be used by researchers interested in exploring how to improve the music listening experience. These playlists were created during the period from January 2010 to October 2017. Each playlist in the MPD contains a playlist title, the track list (including track metadata), editing information (time of last edit, number of edits of the playlist) and other miscellaneous information about the playlist.

The page is a visualization of the network created using Gephi, an open source software package for analyzing networks and graphs. The network was exported with Gephi's Sigma export plugin.
